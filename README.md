In our approach to finding prime numbers within a given range, we chose the Sieve of Eratosthenes for its renowned efficiency and simplicity in identifying primes. This ancient algorithm systematically eliminates the multiples of each prime number, swiftly narrowing down the list to only primes. To further enhance performance, we leveraged multiprocessing, dividing the task across eight threads to utilize the full capacity of the machine's multi-core architecture. This parallel processing significantly reduces execution time by allowing simultaneous computations, making our solution both time and cost-effective, especially important given the rented nature of our computing resources.
To run the code, compile it with a simple compile command and then execute the compiled bytecode. The program does the heavy lifting, going through the numbers, and once it's done, it outputs the total number of primes found and their cumulative sum. It's a practical example of applying multithreading to a computational problem, demonstrating both the power and complexity of concurrent programming in Java.
