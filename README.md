Solution Overview for Labyrinth Scenario
The software models a maze visit by a series of guests, each taking a turn to consume and replace a cupcake. The aim is to monitor until each guest has made one visit. Threads represent each guest, and a ReentrantLock facilitates the sequential maze visits. A 'leader' guest initiates the cupcake eating, followed by alternate guest interactions with the cupcake until everyone has visited the maze once. 

Used Concepts
AtomicInteger allows safe value alteration by multiple threads. ReentrantLock ensures one-at-a-time maze visits. ExecutorService manages the guest threads.

Solution Development
Initially, the problem was comprehended, then a decision was made to apply threads for each guest and a lock to guarantee singular guest visits to the maze.

Solution Overview for Showroom Scenario
The software regulates a delicate vase's viewing by numerous party attendees, allowing one view at a time by lining up guests. Each guest is also a separate thread waiting turn to access the 'viewing room'. 

Each thread views the vase until the total views hit its limit, upon which the viewing concludes. 

Used Concepts
Semaphore permits a single guest thread to access the viewing room. AtomicInteger with CountDownLatch helps track total viewings and signals upon reaching viewing's maximum limit. Thread.sleep() simulates each guest's viewing time.

Solution Development
Grasping the problem was first, where threads access a resource one-by-one using a Semaphore. AtomicInteger with CountDownLatch tracks and signals maximum viewings.

Once the viewing limit is met, the software stops and all guest threads end. The solution was tested for effectiveness. This problem illustrates threads and Java synchronization's effective management of shared resources.

A large part of this solution was determining interactions between the 'leader' guest, other guests, and the cupcake by using an atomic integer count.

Thorough testing of the code was done to check its functioning. Java's built-in features aided in simplifying the problem's solution.
